## How to Get Help
For help with using the pipelines, please see the Wiki of this repository. If your issue is not resolve there, please file a new issue on this repository, and we will troubleshoot the issue. If you are running this software on MSI systems, you can contact the MSI help desk at help [@] msi.umn.edu. If you contact the MSI help desk, be sure to include `CHURP` in the subject line, and please include the command you ran, the samplesheet.txt file, the pipeline.sh file, and a description of the error you are encountering.

## Currently Available Pipelines
The following pipelines have been implemented:

- Group template generation for bulk RNAseq
- Bulk RNAseq

## Current Version
The current version is `1.0.1`, released on 2024-07-23.

## Development Versions
To gain access to a development version, with experimental new features and bug fixes, see the other branches in this repository. Be warned that development versions are highly unstable and not tested for accuracy; you should only use a development version if you are familiar with Python package development and RNAseq analysis "by hand." **We do not support issues arising from a development version of CHURP.**

### Old Versions
If you need to use an older version of the pipelines to reproduce an analysis,
you may download them from the "Releases" section of this repository.
